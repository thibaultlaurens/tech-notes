## **Introduction**

**Software Engineering** is a systematic approach to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of a software system.

### **Objectives**

* **Maintainability:** The software should be able to evolve to meet changing requirements.
* **Correctness:** Requirements specified in the **SRS** should be correctly implemented.
* **Reusability:** The different modules of the product can easily be reused to develop new products.
* **Testability:** The software facilitates both the establishment of test criteria and the evaluation of the software with respect to those criteria.
* **Reliability:** The program can be expected to perform its desired function over an arbitrary time period.
* **Portability:** The software can be transferred from one computer system or environment to another.
* **Adaptability:** The software allows differing system constraints and user needs to be satisfied by making changes to the software.

### Systems development life cycle

* System Investigation
* Analysis
* Design
* Environments
* Testing
* Training and transition
* Operation and maintenance
* Evaluation

### Software development process

* Agile development
* Incremental development
* Rapid application development \(RAD\)
* Spiral development
* Waterfall Model
* V-Shaped Model
* Evolutionary Prototyping

### **The seven principles of software testing**

* **Testing shows presence of defects:** The goal of software testing is to make the software fail. It ****can ensure that defects are present but it can not prove that software is defects free. Testing can reduce the number of defects but not removes all defects.
* **Exhaustive testing is not possible:** The software can never test at every test cases \(in all possible inputs, valid or invalid, and pre-conditions\). It can test only some test cases and assume that software is correct and will produce the correct output in every test cases.
* **Early Testing:** To find the defect in the software, early test activity shall be started. The defect detected in early phases of **SDLC** are less expensive.
* **Defect clustering:** In a project, a small number of the module can contain most of the defects. The **Pareto Principle** applied ****to testing states that 80% of software defect comes from 20% of modules.
* **Pesticide paradox:** Repeating the same test cases again and again will not find new bugs.
* **Testing is context dependent:** Testing approach depends on context of software developed. Different types of software need to perform different types of testing.
* **Absence of errors fallacy:** If a built software is 99% bug-free but it does not follow the user requirement then it is unusable.

### Testing approach

**Static, Dynamic and passive testing:**

**The "box" approach:**

* White box testing
* Black box testing
* Grey box testing

### Testing levels

* Unit testing
* Integration testing
* System testing
* Acceptance testing

### Testing types

* Smoke testing
* Regression testing
* Acceptance testing
* Alpha / Beta testing
* Performance testing
* Usability testing
* Security testing
* A/B testing
