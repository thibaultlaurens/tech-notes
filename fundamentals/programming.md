## Programming Paradigms

## Best practices

### SOLID

- [Single-responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle): Every module, class or function in a computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality, which it should encapsulate.
- [Openâ€“closed principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle): Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- [Liskov substitution principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle): If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of the program.
- [Interface segregation principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle): No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use (split interfaces that are very large into smaller and more specific ones).
- [Dependency inversion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.

### Cloud Native Apps

[The twelve-factor app](https://12factor.net/):

- **Codebase**: One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
- **Dependencies**: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
- **Config**: Store config in the environment
- **Backing services**: Treat backing services as attached resources
- **Build, release, run**: Strictly separate build and run stages
- **Processes**: Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
- **Port binding**: Export services via port binding
- **Concurrency**: Scale out via the process model
- **Disposability**: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
- **Dev/prod parity**: Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
- **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams
- **Admin processes**: Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

## Languages

### Erlang

### Golang

[Go Proverbs](https://go-proverbs.github.io/):

- Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.
- Concurrency is not parallelism.
- Channels orchestrate; mutexes serialize.
- The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction.
- Make the zero value useful.
- interface{} says nothing.
- Gofmt's style is no one's favorite, yet gofmt is everyone's favorite.
- A little copying is better than a little dependency.
- Syscall must always be guarded with build tags.
- Cgo must always be guarded with build tags.
- Cgo is not Go.
- With the unsafe package there are no guarantees.
- Clear is better than clever.
- Reflection is never clear.
- Errors are values.
- Don't just check errors, handle them gracefully.
- Design the architecture, name the components, document the details.
- Documentation is for users.
- Don't panic.
