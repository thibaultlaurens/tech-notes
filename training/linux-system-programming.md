## Fundamental Concepts

### System Calls and library functions

- System call == controlled entry point into kernel code (_syscalls(2)_ man page)
- System calls are expensive !
- Library function == one of multitude of functions in Standard C Library (section 3 of man pages)
- Some library functions employ system calls
- __GNU C library (glibc)__ is most widely used

### Error handling

- Most system calls and library functions return a status indicating success or failure
- Most system calls
	- Return -1 to indicate error
	- Place integer in global variable _errno_ to indicate cause
- Return status should __always__ be tested
- Error numbers in _errno_ are > 0
	- errno(1) man page 
	- <errno.h> defines symbolic names for error numbers 

### System data types

- Various system info needs to be represented in C (Process IDs, user IDs, file offsets, etc.)
- Using native C data types (e.g. int, long) in application code would be non portable
- POSIX defines system data types via __typedef__ (pid_t, uid_t, off_t etc.)

## File I/O

###Â File I/O overview

- All I/O is done using file descriptors (FDs)
	- nonnegative integer that identifies an open files
	- used for all types of files: terminals, regular files, pipes, FIFOs, devices, sockets..
	- 3 FDs are available to programs run from shell: 0 (stdin), 1 (stdout), 2 (stderr)
- Key file I/O system calls: _open()_, _read()_, _write()_, _close()_

### open(), read(), write() and close()

```
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
int open(const char *pathname, int flags, ... /* mode_t mode */);
```

- Opens existing file / creates and open new file
- _flags_: control semantics of call, created by ORing (|) together: 
	- Acess mode: one of O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY or O_RDWR
	- File creation flags: O_CREAT (create file if it doesnt exists), O_EXCL (error if file already exists), O_TRUNC (truncate existing file to 0 length), ...
	- File status flags: O_APPEND (appen writes to end of file), O_SYNC (make file writes synchronous), O_NONBLOCK (nonblocking I/O), ...
- _mode_ specifies permissions when creating new file
- returns a file descriptor (guaranteed to be lowest available FD)

```
#include <unistd.h>
int read(int fd, void *buffer, size_t count);
```

- Args: _fd_ file descriptor, _buffer_ pointer to buffer to store data, _count_ number of bytes to read
- Returns: > 0 (number of bytes read), 0 (end of file), -1 (error)

```
#include <unistd.h>
int write(int fd, const void *buffer, size_t count);
```

- Args: _fd_ file descriptor, _buffer_ pointer to data to be written, _count_ number of bytes to write
- Returns: Number of bytes written, -1 (error)

```  
#include <unistd.h>
int close(fd);
``` 

- check for errors: accidentaly closing same fd twice, FS specific errors (e.g NFS)
- _close()_ __always__ release fd, even on failure return

### The file offset and lseek()

Every open file has a __file offset__:

- Location at which next read or write will occur
- Set to byte 0 on _open()_
- Automatically updated by _read()_, _write()_ etc.
- Synonyms: read-write offset, file pointer

_lseek()_: randomly accessing a file

```
#include <unistd.h>
off_t lseek(int fd, off_t offset, int whence);
```
- Adjusts offset for open file referred to by _fd_ (some file types no seekable: pipes, sockets etc)
- __Returns new file offset__ counted from start of file
- _whence_: how to interpret _offset_:
	- SEEK_SET: relative start of file
	- SEEK_CUR: relative to current position
	- SEEK_END: relative to next byte after EOF
- _offset_ can be negative for SEEK_CUR and SEEK_END

File holes:
- Writing bytes beyond end of file creates a __file hole__
- Holes __don't__ consume space (saves disk space)
- Use cases: core dump files, sparse files (nominal size >>> allocated size), VM images
- Subsequent writes into holes cause blocks to be allocated 

### Relationship between file descriptors and open files

Relationship between file descriptors and open files:
- 3 kernel data structures describe files: File descriptor table (process wide), Open file table (system wide), I-node table (system wide)
- Multiple file descriptors can refer to the same open file
- Multiple Open files can refer to the same I-node

File descriptor table (_struct fdtable_ in _include/linux/fdtable.h_):
- Per process table with one entry for each FD opened by process
- Flags controlling operation of FD
- Reference to open file description (file ptr)

Table of open file descriptions (_struct file_ in _include/linux/fs.h_)
- File offset
- File access mode (R / W / R-W, from _open()_)
- File status flags (from _open()_)
- Reference to inode object for file

I-node table (_struct inode_ in _include/linux/fs.h_)
- File type (regular file, FIFO, socket, ...)
- File permissions
- Other file properties (size, timestamps, ...)

Duplicated file descriptors:
- intraprocess: a process may have multiple FDs referring to same OFD, achieved using _dup()_ or _dup2()_
- between processes: two processes may have FDs referring to same OFD, achieved using _for()_
- two processes may have FDs referring to distinct OFDs that refer to same inode (_open()_ on the same file)

Why it matters:
- 2 different FDs referring to same OFD share file offset (intraprocess and interprocess)
- Similar scope rules for status flags, changes via one FD are visible via other FD
- Conversely, changes to FD flags are private to each process FD

### Duplicating file descriptors

```
#include <unistd.h>
int dup(int oldfd);
```

- _oldfd_: an existing file descriptor
- Returns new file descriptor (on success)
- __New file descriptor is guaranteed to be lowest available__
- Problematic if a lower FD is being closed when closing and duplicating a FD (to achieve shell 2>&1 redirection for instance)

```
#include <unistd.h>
int dup2(int oldfd, int newfd);
```

- Like _dup()_ but close and reuse _newfd_ atomically
- Does nothing if _oldfd == newfd_
- Returns a new file descriptor (_newfd_) on success

### File status flags (and fcntl())

File status flags
- Control semantics of I/O on a file (O_APPEND, O_SYNC, O_NONBLOCKING, ...)
- Associated with open file description
- Set when file is open
- Can be retrieved and modified using _fcntl()_

_fcntl()_: file control operations (check access mode, change file status flags etc.)

```
#include <unistd.h>
int fcntl(int fd, int cmd, /* , args */ );
```

- _cmd_: the desired operation (F_GETFL to retrieve flags, F_SETFL to modify flags)
- _arg_: optional, type depends on _cmd_

### Other file I/O interfaces

```
#include <unistd.h>
int truncate(const char *pathname, off_t length);
int ftruncate(int fd, off_t length);
```

- Truncate a file via pathname (_truncate()_) or descriptor (_ftruncate()_)
- length < current size => data is lost
- length > current size => null bytes (a hole) added at EOF
- Does not change file offset !

I/O at a specific location: _pread()_ and _pwrite()_ 
- Useful in multithreaded program when different threads want to do I/O in different parts of the same file
- Does not change file offset ! (whereas _lseek()_ in one thread would affect offset seen by __all__ threads)

Scatter-gather I/O: _readv()_ and _writev()_
- _readv()_: reads contiguous block from file, scatters (splits) data accross multiple buffers
- _writev()_: gathers output data from multiple buffers (written one after the other in file)
- __Advantage__: reduces number of system calls
- Buffers are described via _struct iovec []_ argument

_preadv()_ and _pwritev()_
- _preadv()_ == _pread()_ + _readv()_
- _pwritev()_ == _pwrite()_ + _writev()_
- Linux specific, since 2.6.30

/proc/PID/fd
- Each process has a corresponding /proc/PID/fd directory containing symbolic links for each of the process's FDs
- ex: /proc/PID/fd/n == symlink to file opened on descriptor n by process PID

## File I/O Buffering

### Kernel buffering

Two kinds of file I/O buffering: within kernel (the buffer cache) and in user space

Kernel buffering of file I/O:
- _read()_ and _write()_ __don't__ directly cause disk accesses
- Just transfer data between kernel and user space
- Within kernel, data is buffered in the _buffer_ cache
	- System-wide resource
	- Limited only by available memory
	- Strictly speaking: buffer cache == page cache 

Advantages of the buffer cache:
- __Speed__: _read()_ and _write()_ don't block on disk transfer
- __Efficiency__: kernel makes fewer disk transfers

Effect of buffer size on file I/O performance:
- _write(fd, buf, 4096);_ vs _for (j = 0; j < 4096; j++) write(fd, &buf[j], 1);_
- Same output file, same number of buffer cache flushes but __different number of system calls__ (expensive!)
- 4096 bytes is near optimum performance for file I/O

### User-space (stdin) buffering

_stdio_ has three buffering modes:
- __Line-buffered__: default mode on stdin/stdout on terminal devices: output/input flushed/available only when newline character is written/entered
- __Block buffered__: default mode for block devices (disks): I/O is buffered in "blocks" (default BUFSIZ (8192) bytes), output (_write()_) flushed only when buffer is full
- __Unbufered__: default to stderr: each I/O operations results in an immediate _read()_ / _write()_ call

Disable _stdio_ buffering via _setvbuf(3)_ and _setbuf(3)_: occasionally useful but impact performace
Flush _stdio_ buffers via _fflush(fp)_. Transfer (output) data only to kernel buffer cache (must __flush buffer cache to ensure data lands on disk__) 

### Controlling kernel buffering

Kernel __automatically__ flushes modified pages in buffer cache to disk:
- Within 30 seconds (/proc/sys/vm/dirty_expire_centisecs (3000))
- Or, in response to memory pressure

Application can also perform __explicit buffer flushing__ on two types of data:
- __File data__
- __Metadata__ describing file (size, last modification time, ownership, permissions, data block pointers, ...)

Explicity flushing modified buffers:
- _fsync(fd)_: __flush data and metadata__ associated with open file referred by _fd_
- _fdatasync(fd)_: Same as _fsync()_ but __only flush metadata if__ changes would be needed in order to subsequently read data (potentially cheaper than _fsync()_)
- _sync(void)_: Flush all modified buffers for all files
- _fsync(fd)_, _fdatasync(fd)_ and _sync(void)_ all block until synchronization is complete (POSIX permits _sync()_ to merely __schedule__ sync operation)
- Flushing buffer cache doesn't guarantee data has landed on media surface because of disk hardware caching
- Set O_SYNC flag to disable buffer cache and make all writes to a file synchronous and block until data has been transferred to disk (massive performance hit!)

## Standards and Portability

### Standards: why ?

- __1969__: UNIX first implemented, developped at Bell Labs (AT&T)
- 1979: Seventh Edition (V7) UNIX
- After V7, UNIX starts to fragment: __BSD__ (Berkeley Software Distribution from UCB), __System V__ (AT&T), vendor implementations based on System V or BSD
- Mid-1980s: "UNIX" is a chaos of competing, increasingly incompatible implementations, "The UNIX wars": __UNIX Internation__ (AT&T, Sun) vs __Open Software Foundation__ (the rest)
- Pressure to standardize results in POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) and other standards 

### Standards: POSIX

- __POSIX.1__ (1990): Sheperd by IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), API standard for (UNIX like) OS
- __POSIX.2__ (1992): Standard for shell and utilities
- POSIX.1b (1993): Realtime APIs
- POSIX.1c (1995): Threads APIs
- POSIX.1 (1996): Consolidation of POSIX.1-1990, POSIX.1b, POSIX.1c

### XPG and SUS

- 1989: __X/Open__ founded by a consortium of computer vendors for a comprehensive set of open system standards
- __X/Open Portability Guides (XPG)__: Consolidation of POSIX and various other standards
- XPG subsequently repackaged as __Single UNIX Specification (SUS)__ (1994: SUSv1 - XPG4v2, 1997: SUSv2 - XPG5)
- 1996: X/Open merges with Open Software Foundation => __The Open Group__ (TOG); virtually every UNIX vendor is a member nowadays; unofficial end of "The UNIX wars"
- 1999: IEEE, TOG and ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1 collaborate in __Austin Common Standards Revision Group__ to revise POSIX and SUS standards and consolidate into a single standard
- 2001: combined POSIX.1-2001 and SUSv3 published as a modular standard; SUSv3 == POSIX + XSI (X/Open System Interface) extension
- 2008: POSIX.1-2008 / SUSv4 published 

### Linux and standards

- Linux now dominant, but portability is still valuable goal
- Linux not standards certified, but largely standards compliant
