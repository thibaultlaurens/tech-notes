### History of Infra as Code

By Andrew Clay Shafer - VP Transformation @RedHat

- A language is a structured system of communication. Both our human and computer languages enable, shape, and constrain the concepts we can effectively express.
- Infrastructure as Code:
  - Use all our software tricks: software development lifecycle, versionning, testing.
  - Be wary of the software pitfalls.
- Everything is a software built on top of silicon.
- Timeline from 1990 to 2010: **CFEngine -> bcfg2 -> Puppet -> Chef -> SaltStack -> Ansible**.
- Control Loops: from **Current State** to **Desired State**.

### Security and the Language of Intent

By Tracy Holmes - Developer Advocate @HashiCorp

- Infrastructure as code empowers developers and operators to scale systems and maximize availability, but what about improving security?
- Exemple: how to secure a database ? (secrets, lock subnets and ports, low priviledges, encryption, ACL..)
- Benefits of **Policy as Code**: Sandboxing, Codification, Version control, Testing, Automation, Balance dev experience and security
- **HashiCorp Sentinel**: use policy as code to communicate and translate the security intentions you want and expect in your infrastructure.
- Sentinel policy enforcement is only available in TF Cloud or TF Enterprise.
- Open soutce alternative to Sentinal: OPA (**Open Policy Agent**)

### A Sticky Situation: How Netflix Gains Confidence in Changes

By Haley Tucker - Senior Software Engineer, Resilience Team @Netflix

- How do you know whether a change will affect end users in a negative way?
- Canary deployments: Introduce a new service into the environment, users are randomly routed to that service, compare the performance of that service vs the current production build.
- Problem: this doesnâ€™t really tell us anything about what the end users are experiencing, it focuses on service-level metrics.
- Netflix ChAP (**Chaos Automation Platform**) as a canary (experiment) platform.
- **Sticky Canaries**: Users are allocated for the duration of the experiment and can be filtered (by location, devices etc.).
- **Fault Injection**: Test how a new release behave under pressure.
- **Early Shutoff**: Automatically terminate experiment when customer impact is detected.
- **Canary Analysis**: Automatically generates reports and graphs at the end of the experiment.
- Benefits of Sticky Canaries: reduce experiment duration, reduce time to detect issues, deploy with confidence.
- Use cases: migrations, data changes, api changes.. (backward compatibility are only assumptions in complex systems)
- Can't be applied to: low volume services, no production traffic, services not directly related to KPIs

Takeway:

- Build hooks into your platform to enable the types of experiments you need.
- Provide guard rails for testing in production.
- Monitor customer KPIs - not proxy metrics.

### Architecting Resilient Data

By Jim Walker - VP Product Marketing @CockroachDB

- Our applications all fail at some point in time. It is unavoidable. What if it is the database ?
- The costly impacts of database downtime: customer loss, reputation impact, team stress, lost revenue potential..
- RTO (**Recovery Time Objective**): The amount of time an application can be down without causing significant damage ?
- RPO (**Recovey Point Objective**): The amount of data that can be lost before significant damage occurs.
- Limitations of active/passive (primary/secondary) strategies: costs, complexity (especially true with sharding), backups, synchronization/conflict issues..
- Distributed SQL and active-active data try to bring the best of both SQL (transactions) and NoSQL (resilience) world.

### Paving the Road to Production

By Graham Jenson Infrastructure Tech Lead @Coinbase

- The journey of Ops at Coinbase, from day one to now with exponential growth.
- 1st stage: startup - YOLO deploy in Heroku and Bob the admin, but Bob is a blocker.
- 2nd stage: AWS, docker, open culture, deploy first day, move fast and break things.
- 3rd stage: Use proper automation and deployment tools. Had to build it (CodeFlow) to fit the special company need but also because such tools did not exist yet.
- 4th stage: The only way to scale is to document everything (think 100+ projects), build more custom tool for specific developments/deployments, finally build a framework to keep it all consistent.
- 5th stage: 4th stage was not enough so Monorepo + Bazel + custom CLI (500+ projects to maintains)
- Tomorrow: Time to split the organization.
- Conclusion: Iterate and improve ops/deployments continuously, try to keep it consistent, don't build one road (to production) per car (projects). Instead, try to build a highway where everyone can drive (be consistent or you won't scale).
