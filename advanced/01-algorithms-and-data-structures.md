# Algorithms & Data structures

## Introduction

## Indexing

- Binary Search Trees
- AVL Trees
- Red-Black Trees
- Splay Trees
- Open Hash Tables \(Closed Addressing\)
- Closed Hash Tables \(Open Addressing\)
- Closed Hash Tables, using buckets
- Trie \(Prefix Tree, 26-ary Tree\)
- Radix Tree \(Compact Trie\)
- Ternary Search Tree \(Trie with BST of children\)
- B Trees
- B+ Trees

## Sorting

- Bucket Sort

## Graphs Algorithms

- Depth-First Search
- Connected Components
- Prim's Minimum Cost Spanning Tree
- Topological Sort \(Using Indegree array\)
- Topological Sort \(Using DFS\)
- Floyd-Warshall \(all pairs shortest paths\)
- Kruskal Minimum Cost Spanning Tree Algorithm

## Dynamic Programming
