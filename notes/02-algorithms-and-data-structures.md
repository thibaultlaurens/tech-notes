# Algorithms & Data structures

## Introduction

See the [Grokking Algorithms](books/01-grokking-algorithms.md) book review.

**TLDR**:

- Big O notation: constant, linear, logarithmic, linearithmic, square root, quadratic, cubic, polynomial, exponential, factorial
- Data structures: arrays, linked lists, hash tables, stacks, queues, graphs, sets
- Design: Tail recursion and Divide and conquer
- Search algorithms: linear search and binary search
- Sorting algorithms: insertion sort and selection sort \(simple sorts\), merge sort and quicksort \(efficient sorts\)
- Graph algorithms: Breadth-first search, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm
- Greedy algorithms and NP-complete problems
- Dynamic Programming
- K-nearest neighbors \(KNN\)

## Indexing

- Binary Search Trees
- AVL Trees
- Red-Black Trees
- Splay Trees
- Open Hash Tables \(Closed Addressing\)
- Closed Hash Tables \(Open Addressing\)
- Closed Hash Tables, using buckets
- Trie \(Prefix Tree, 26-ary Tree\)
- Radix Tree \(Compact Trie\)
- Ternary Search Tree \(Trie with BST of children\)
